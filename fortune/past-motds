I suppose some of the variation between Boston drivers and the rest of the
country is due to the progressive Massachusetts Driver Education Manual which
I happen to have in my top desk drawer.  Some of the Tips for Better Driving
are worth considering, to wit:

[110.13]:
       "When traveling on a one-way street, stay to the right, so as not
        to interfere with oncoming traffic."

[22.17b]:
       "Learning to change lanes takes time and patience.  The best
        recommendation that can be made is to go to a Celtics [basketball]
        game; study the fast break and then go out and practice it
        on the highway."

       "Never bump a baby carriage out of a crosswalk unless the kid's really
        asking for it."

We were young and our happiness dazzled us with its strength.  But there was
also a terrible betrayal that lay within me like a Merle Haggard song at a
French restaurant. [...]
	I could not tell the girl about the woman of the tollway, of her milk
white BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a fight.  I had punched her
boyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone told him, "You ride the
bull, senor.  You do not fight it."  But he was lean and tough like a bad
rib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he fought me.  And when we finished
there were no winners, just men doing what men must do. [...]
	"Stop the car," the girl said.
	There was a look of terrible sadness in her eyes.  She knew about the
woman of the tollway.  I knew not how.  I started to speak, but she raised an
arm and spoke with a quiet and peace I will never forget.
	"I do not ask for whom's the tollway belle," she said, "the tollway
belle's for thee."
	The next morning our youth was a memory, and our happiness was a lie.
Life is like a bad margarita with good tequila, I thought as I poured whiskey
onto my granola and faced a new day.

In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Mississippi has
shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles.  Therefore ... in the Old
Silurian Period the Mississippi River was upward of one million three hundred
thousand miles long ... seven hundred and forty-two years from now the
Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long.  ... There is
something fascinating about science.  One gets such wholesome returns of
conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.

In a minimum-phase system there is an inextricable link between
frequency response, phase response and transient response, as they
are all merely transforms of one another.  This combined with
minimalization of open-loop errors in output amplifiers and correct
compensation for non-linear passive crossover network loading can
lead to a significant decrease in system resolution lost.  However,
this all means jack when you listen to Pink Floyd.

FORTUNE DISCUSSES THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN:        #17

Shoes:
         The average man has 4 pairs of footwear: running shoes, dress shoes,
boots, and slippers.  The average woman has shoes 4 layers thick on the floor
of her closet.  Most of them hurt her feet.
 
Making friends:
         A woman will meet another woman with common interests, do a few things
together, and say something like, "I hope we can be good friends."
        A man will meet another man with common interests, do a few things

If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to
get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude.
See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving
the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting

and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to
rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective.
Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure

opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for

Pisces Feb.19-Mar.20 
   You have a vivid imagination and often think
   you are being followed by the CIA or FBI.  You have minor
   influence over your associates, and people resent you for
   flaunting your power.  You lack confidence and are generally a
   coward.  Pisces people do terrible things to small animals.

Not that everything is worth remembering, obviously. For example, sitting
next to me is one of the notes I wrote in the middle of the night last
week, which says "Jim Bo". I had woken up with a sudden desire to make an
exercise video (this is unusual, for me). I would invent a new martial art
and exercise program called "Jim Bo", in which people learn how to defend
themselves without spilling their beer. Picture a group of people going
through slow-motion kicks and punches while holding a glass of microbrew.
Later, in the harsh cold light of morning, I realized that I'd probably
never be able to get the obvious spokesman (James Belushi) involved, and
that even if everything else went well, I'd run the risk of having to
appear on a talk show with Richard Simmons. Some things are just too
scary to contemplate.

I'm talking about death, and you've never experienced that - and you cannot
act it.  You die a thousand casual deaths, with none of that intensity which
squeezes out life . . . and no blood runs cold anywhere, because even as you
"die" you know that you will come back in a different hat.  But no one gets
up after death.  There is no applause.  There is only silence and some second-
hand clothes, and _that's_ death.

If you wish to glimpse inside a human soul and get to know a man, don't
bother analyzing his ways of being silent, of talking, of weeping, or

    How it is possible to imagine that a religion breathing the spirit of
mercy and benevolence, teaching the forgiveness of injuries, the exercise 
of charity, and the return of good for evil, can be so perverted as to 
breathe the spirit of slaughter and persecution, of discord and vengeance, 
for differences of opinion, is a most unaccountable and extraordinary 
phenomenon. Still more extraordinary, that it should be the doctrine, 
not of base and wicked men merely seeking to cover up their own misdeeds, 
but of good men, seeking the way of salvation with uprightness of heart 
and purpose. It affords a melancholy proof of the infirmity of human 
judgment, and teaches a lesson of humility from which spiritual pride 
may learn meekness, and spiritual zeal a moderating wisdom.

The most important moral of all is that excellence is where you find 
it. I would extend this generalization to cover not just higher 
education but all education from vocational high school to graduate 
school. We must learn to honor excellence, indeed to demand it in every 
socially accepted human activity, however humble that activity, and to 
scorn shoddiness, however exalted the activity. An excellent plumber is 
infinitely more admirable than an incompetent philosopher. The society 
which scorns excellence in plumbing because plumbing is a humble 
activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because philosophy is 
an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good 
philosophy. Neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.

Dad said, "Bring Belle over here." He took a rag, soaked it with gasoline,
and scrubbed the dog's backside with it to disguise the scent, and said
"OK, you can go now, but keep Belle on the leash and only go one time round

brought with it seven wild horses. 'Wow!' they said, 'Aren't you lucky!'
He said 'maybe.' He next day, his son grappled with one of these wild
horses and tried to break it in, and he got thrown and broke his leg.
And all the neighbors said 'oh, that's too bad that your son broke his
leg.' He said, 'maybe.' The next day, the conscription officers came
around, gathering young men for the army, and they rejected his son
because he had a broken leg. And the visitors all came around and said

This is a bit of the continent, sticking out into the warmer sea to the
south-east. Most of its inhabitants call it Florida.

Actually, they don't. Most of its inhabitants don't call it anything.
They don't even know it exists. Most of them have six legs, and buzz. A
lot of them have eight legs and spend a lot of time in webs waiting for
six-legged inhabitants to arrive for lunch. Many of the rest have four
legs, and bark or moo or even lie in swamps pretending to be logs. In
fact, only a tiny proportion of the inhabitants of Florida have two
legs, and even most of them don't call it Florida. They just go tweet,
and fly around a lot.

Mathematically, an almost insignificant amount of living things in
Florida call it Florida. But they're the ones who matter. At least, in
their opinion. And their opinion is the one that matters. In their
opinion.

government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there 
aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to 
be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking 
laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that 
for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed

first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so
little towards "fuming," you will say "fuming-furious;" if they turn, by
even a hair's breadth, towards "furious," you will say "furious-fuming;"
but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will
say "frumious."

  As personal choice, we tend not to use debuggers beyond getting a
  stack trace or the value of a variable or two. One reason is that it
  is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and
  control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive
  than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking
  code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than
  scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less
  time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to
  the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that
  is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program;
  debugging sessions are transient.

Both bridges accomplish daring feats, but Maillart's possesses the added
virtue of making its achievement look effortless- and because we sense it
isn't, we wonder at it and admire it all the more. The bridge is endowed
with a subcategory of beauty we can refer to as elegance, a quality present
whenever a work of architecture succeeds in carrying out an act of
resistance -- holding, spanning, sheltering -- with grace and economy as 
well as strength; when it has the modesty not to draw attention to the
difficulties it has surmounted.

I have never read the Church-Turing thesis as "C is Turing complete, so you
might as well use C for all your programming tasks". I read it almost the
opposite way: "choose whatever language you want, because I can always write

able to choose between the uneasy handwaving of Perl and the frustrating
precision of Agda?

Approaches To Process:

Alas, I cannot make the same positive statement with regard to process:
there exists considerable diversity in thought over how the object-oriented
project should conduct its business. To that end, I roughly divide the
object-oriented world into five somewhat overlapping schools of philosophy
regarding process:

  * The anarchists, who largely ignore process and prefer to be left 
    alone with their computers.
  * The behaviorists, whose focus is upon identifying and then evolving 
    roles and responsibilities.
  * The storyboarders, who see the world in terms of scenarios.
  * The information modelers, who focus on data and treat behavior as
    secondary.
  * The architects, who focus upon frameworks (both building and using 
    them).

Haskell was developed by Isaac Newton in the 15th Century as a tool to
help his investigations into the Alchemic arts. It was rediscovered in
the 1980s by three Cambridge undergraduates who were browsing through
Newton's laboratory notebooks looking for smutty jokes in the margins,
and has since developed into an elaborate joke perpetrated by elite
computer scientists who believe that predictable order of execution is
contrary to natural law. The current version of Haskell is Haskell 1714,
which adds syntactic sugar for Zygohistomorphic Premorphisms to the
original language definition of 1693.

The simplest thing that we can do right now is to rethink how we
document libraries. Automatic documentation tools like Javadoc and Rdoc
are good for producing thick stacks of paper, but not so hot at actually
telling library users the things they need to know. They are the source
of most of the world's "newRecordAddedHook is called when a new record
is added" documentation. They can be useful, but they are no substitute
for actually writing about the library: single-page summaries that
answer the three key questions: what the library does, why you should
use it, and how to do so. For bonus points, the one-page summary should
avoid using the word "enterprise" (unless it's a library of Star Trek
ships) and "innovative."

But defensive programming is a double-edged sword—from the point of view of
debugging, it just makes our lives harder. It transforms what would otherwise
be simple and obvious bugs into bugs that are obscure, difficult to detect,
and difficult to diagnose. We may want our software to be as robust as
possible in production, but it’s much easier to debug fragile software that
falls over immediately when a bug manifests.

A common example is the almost universal for loop idiom, in which, instead of
writing this:

    for (i = 0; i != iteration_count; ++i)
      «Body of loop»

we write the following defensive version:

    for (i = 0; i < iteration_count; ++i)
      «Body of loop»

In almost all cases, both loops behave identically, iterating from zero to
iteration_count - 1. So, why do so many of us automatically write the second,
not the first?

The reason is because if the body of the loop happens to assign to i so that
it becomes larger than iteration_count, the first version of our loop won’t
terminate. By using < in our test instead of !=, we can guarantee that the
loop will terminate if this happens.

The problem with this is that if the loop index does become larger than
iteration_count, it almost certainly means that the code contains a bug. And
whereas with the first version of the code we would immediately notice that it
did (because the software hung inside an infinite loop), now it may not be at
all obvious. It will probably bite us at some point in the future and be very
difficult to diagnose.

Computer languages seem to evolve on a much slower scale since their
semantics are firmly grounded in their interpretation by silicone, but
if you look at the evolution of programming languages over the years you
will see the same pattern of development that occurs when pidgins become
creolized, when natural language moves from cuneiform record keeping to
the age of mass publication, or when children learn language in
general— a movement away from concatenative sorts of structure and
towards term-based structures, as well as the development of pervasive
structural moods and morphologies which are holistically integrated and
intuitively understandable rather than ad-hoc and inexplicable.

I’d be hesitant to call the old languages like assembler, Fortran, or
Cobol “languages” in the colloquial sense and not a technical or
metaphorical sense. But more modern languages like Haskell and Perl
resemble natural language far more than they’re given credit for. One
of the problematic issues here is that there are some very old
discourses at stake here, both for and against the idea of
programming/computer/mathematical languages as languages; and
unfortunately, I think some of the past advocates for the idea have done
more damage to its reputation than the critics (because those advocates
are typically more interested in mathematizing natural language than in
languagifying mathematical formalisms).

Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, 18:

Do not be troubled by the fact that languages (2) and (8) consist only
of orders. If you want to say that this shews them to be incomplete,
ask yourself whether our language is complete;---whether it was so
before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the
infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to
speak, suburbs of our language. (And how many houses or streets does
it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our language can be seen
as an ancient city: a
maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of
houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a
multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform
houses.

I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice
in the death of one, not even an enemy.  Returning hate for hate
multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of
stars.  Darkness cannot drive out darkness:  only light can do that.
Hate cannot drive out hate:  only love can do that.

  WADLER'S LAW OF LANGUAGE DESIGN
  In any language design, the total time spent discussing
  a feature in this list is proportional to two raised to
  the power of its position.
       0. Semantics
       1. Syntax
       2. Lexical syntax
       3. Lexical syntax of comments

%

Why should we love our enemies?  The first reason is fairly obvious.
Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a
night already devoid of stars.  Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only
light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness
multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction.  So when
Jesus says 'Love your enemies,' he is setting forth a profound and
ultimately inescapable admonition.  Have we not come to such an impasse
in the modern world that we must love our enemies - or else? The chain
reaction of evil - hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars -
must be broken or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of
annihilation.

I like to think of it in terms of the following fairy tale. Long ago,
if you were a shepherd and wanted to see if two finite sets of sheep
were isomorphic, the most obvious way would be to look for an
isomorphism. In other words, you would try to match each sheep in herd A
with a sheep in herd B. But one day, along came a shepherd who invented
decategorification. This person realized you could take each set and
"count" it, setting up an isomorphism between it and some set of
"numbers", which were nonsense words like "one, two, three, four,..."
specially designed for this purpose. By comparing the resulting numbers,
you could see if two herds were isomorphic without explicitly
establishing an isomorphism!

According to this fairy tale, decategorification started out as the
ultimate stroke of mathematical genius. Only later did it become a
matter of dumb habit, which we are now struggling to overcome through
the process of "categorification".

The logical calculus is easier to execute than any of the 
techniques of mathematics itself, yet only in 1934 did Gerhard Gentzen set it 
out in a natural way. Even now, mathematics students are expected to learn 
complicated (e- d)-proofs in analysis with no help in understanding the 
logical structure of the arguments. Examiners fully deserve the garbage that 
they get in return.
