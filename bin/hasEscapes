#  Simple test for use in shell scripts to see whether something (typically
#  the output of a command, such as ls --color=yes) has any escape characters.
#
#  grep -q would be nicer, if I could find a way to make it look for an
#  escape character (and could be sure that it would work in a cross-platform
#  way).
