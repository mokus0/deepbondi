#       "TOP" to cause a 'git-all' script in the current dir to be run
#             instead of this script (for example, the ghc source dist
#             includes a git-all script).
#       "ANYWHERE" to cause a 'git-all' script in any subdir to take over 
#             and do the processing for that subtree.
#   If unset or set to anything else, git-all scripts will be ignored.
#   Obviously, use GIT_ALL_USE_CWD_VERSION cautiously if at all.
